# Face dectection system
The aim of the project is to detect faces into images : 
* A model has been learned from 500 labelled images. 
* The model can be used to detect faces. The detection boxes are retrieved in a text file in the following format : image number, coordinates of the top left corner of the box, size of the box and detection score.
